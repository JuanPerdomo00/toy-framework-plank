# http-mini-framework

Example of a minimalist framework, it is in a very beginner state. Please note that the only important thing to be able to run this example is to have bun installed.


To run:

```bash
bun run --watch index.js
```

To dev

```sh
# to add commit
git branch developmen
```

- If not bun
[Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
